# madplotlib-challenge
Module 5 Challenge

- By Ryan MacFarlane - 

- All code was written by me, Ryan MacFarlane.  However - I did receive guidance from my tutor this week, Kourt Bailey - as well as classmates Adrian Gonzalez and Casey Waggoner.

- Code was written, run and tested in Visual Studio Code.  Analysis added at a cell at the top of the script as a comment - apologies for formatting.

- Thank you for viewing/grading!
